# LLM-Enhanced-Human-Robot-Interaction-for-Multi-Robot-Masonry-Construction
This project is developed in Webots to design an intelligent masonry system, and a GUI interface is created using PyCharm. By integrating the ChatGPT API as the upper-level controller of the system, human–robot interaction and real-time monitoring of the masonry process are achieved.
