# LLM-Enhanced-Human-Robot-Interaction-for-Multi-Robot-Masonry-Construction  
## Project Introduction
This project is based on Webots and designs an intelligent masonry system, which includes a brick-handling robot, a vision-guided masonry robot, and a cement-spraying robot. A GUI interface is developed in PyCharm, and by integrating the ChatGPT API as the upper-level controller of the system, human–robot interaction and real-time monitoring of the masonry process are implemented.  
There are two versions of the project:
* The first version does not include GPT. It runs directly in Webots, where the masonry system automatically completes the construction of a five-layer wall.
* The second version integrates GPT. When running this version, you need to execute the GUI.py file in PyCharm. After the GUI window appears, you can input natural-language commands to control the system and perform masonry operations.
## Project Opening Guide  
### intelligent system (intelligent_system.zip)  
Open z2i_7.wbt directly from the worlds folder and run it.
### intelligent system GPT version (intelligent_system_GPT.zip)  
First, open z2i_7.wbt, then open the GUI.py file. Make sure all required libraries and environments are properly installed, and then run GUI.py. A GUI window will pop up, allowing you to send natural-language commands in the dialog box (for example: build 2 layers of bricks).

Note: Due to system-related issues, the bricks generated by the random brick-generation function may occasionally fail to stack correctly. If this occurs, simply reset the world, reload the world, and then rerun GUI.py.  

Since the API key of OpenAI cannot be published on the internet, before running the chatgpt-gui system, you need to find a valid API key again and copy and paste it to replace the original one. Just modify the line of "OpenAI key" in the GUI.py program and fill in the correct key.
